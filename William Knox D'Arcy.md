## Finding Oil In Persia
### Where Did He Get The Chance to Explore Oil?
The opportunity came in 1900 when Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, a former British minister to Teheran, approached him to invest in Persian oil exploration

### Financial Troubles:
At the end of 1903 he had spent £150,000 with no result. His financial position was now desperate.

He began negotiations with the French branch of the Rothschild family for the sale of the concession.


On 20 May the British owned Burmah Oil Co. stepped in with an offer. D'Arcy agreed to it and made over the rights to his concession in return for 170,000 Burmah Oil shares and a payment to cover expenses he had incurred.


The first strike of any value was made in May 1908 in southwestern Iran and led to the formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909, Later [[British Petroleum]].
### D'Arcy Concession
Negotiations with the [Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mozaffar_al-Din_Shah_Qajar "Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar") began in 1901, and with the offer of £20,000 (£2.3 million today),[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/William_Knox_D'Arcy#cite_note-inflation-UK-4) for a sixty-year concession to explore for oil— later, the [[D'Arcy concession]] —was secured in May, covering 480,000 square miles (1,200,000 km2), and stipulated that D'Arcy would have the oil rights to the entire country except for five provinces in Northern Iran.
