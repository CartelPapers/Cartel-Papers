## Founding

> His uncle was kind to him, offered him a corner of the lumber yard in which to build a shop all the lumber he needed and a thousand dollars in money. With that my father built a small brass foundry, set up his furnace and had everything in order on July 3, 1855. He was so anxious to try the work that he poured off his first pot of metal on July 4, 1855, establishing a tiny business which grew into the [[Crane Holding Company |Crane Company]]."

The company was founded by [[Richard Teller Crane]] and his brother Charles S Crane. It originally sold brass goods and plumbing supplies. 


## Expansion
The name of the Company was then changed to [[Crane Holding Company|Northwest Manufacturing Company]]. During this time it supplied essential steam components to the railroad. Crane Elevator Company begins making hoists, elevators and steam engines, becoming one of the major names in the field for 30 years.
