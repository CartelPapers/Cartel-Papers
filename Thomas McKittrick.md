### Why McKittrick
On the surface McKittrick seemed a curious Choice. He was a lawyer by training with no direct experience of central banking. But that mattered little, for war was coming. All sides already agreed that the financial channels must be kept open during the conflict. In that sense McKittrick was the perfect candidate. He was citizen of both a neutral country - the united states- and of thew worlds newest hinterland- transnational finance. [^1]

Mckittrick repeatedly claims that hee had no knowledge of his future employment at the BIS but in March 1939 whispers began to float around primarily on the content that he is going to be the new BIS president. 

The stater deparment originally denied Mckittrick to travel to europe (at the time he was in the US working at [[Lee Higginson & Co.]]) European countries somehow applied enough pressure to the state department to let him pass but what is important to remember here is that, [[John Foster Dulles]] who at the time was atleast aquainted with [[Thomas McKittrick]] was known as "(being the) state department (itself)".

The he was sent to Liverpool Where he was stationed with [[British Military Intelligence]] to make sure no spy activity was occuring in Liverpool: the reason an American was stationed doing this was because the "National Union Of Seamen" A trade union didnt allow britishmen to go through their  members.
