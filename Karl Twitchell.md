In 1923, Ibn Saud gave an oil concession in the al-Hasa district to an English oil 
group calling itself the Eastern and General Syndicate, for £2000 a year. This group 
was represented at that time by Major Holmes. 2 The company carried out several 
attempts at exploration, but was at last compelled to withdraw due to financial 
problems. The concession was finally cancelled in 1928, due to the company's failure 
to pay the rent to Ibn Saud. Thus, the district remained unexploited (Howarth 
1964: 183; Longrigg, 1968: 100; al-Zirikli, 1977a: 692-694; Almana, 1980:217-218; 
Holden and Johns, 1981: 111-112). However, the most important factor in the 
deterioration of relations between King Abdulaziz and Britain was the oil concession 
which was given to the Standard Oil Company of California (SOCAL) in Jeddah on 
29 May 1933

Two years later, though, Twitchell returned, this time in the service of Standard Oil of California (Chevron), which outbid a British representative of the Iraq Petroleum Company (now BP) for exploration rights in eastern Ara- bia. For a cash loan amounting to 50,000 gold sovereigns (about $300,000, now worth $3 million), plus an annual rent of 5,000 more, Ibn Sa’ud gave the Americans a sixty-year concession to search for oil in Hasa, with prefer- ential exploration rights in other parts of his kingdom. 

Just as the concession was being renegotiated in 1939, competition appeared in the form of a Japanese offer. The Japanese offer had been transmitted by the Italian Minister to Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the German Minister to Iraq who was also accredited to Saudi Arabia called in Jidda to further the drama. Twitchell asserts that the offer was so "fantastic" that Aramco had to admit that, for its part, such terms were not commercially practicable and that Aramco could not match such an offer. 5 Tempting or not.
King Ibn Saud chose to continue dealing with his American friends, thus leaving the Japanese and the Germans empty- handed.

When Karl Twitchell, an American mining engineer, rediscovered the site, it included about three hundred thousand tons of tailings containing about three-quarters of an ounce of gold per ton. e ancients had recovered all the visible gold. Twitchell sold the American Smelting and Refning Company (ASARCO) on the idea of forming a syndicate to develop the property.
