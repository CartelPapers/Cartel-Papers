## Childhood
**Royall Tyler came from a well-established New England family.** After his father died, his mother, the daughter of a Slovak immigrant, moved to Europe, taking young Royall with her. He went to school in England, but then spent considerable time in Spain, France, and Germany. He learned to speak the major western languages fluently, which proved a great advantage later on in his life and profession. 

## US Military
Although he had mixed feelings about his home country (The United States), when the US joined the war effort in 1917, he joined the US Army. He was commissioned as a Lieutenant but at the end of the war was promoted to the rank of Major.

Due to his exposure to a wide amount of languages, such as : English, French, Spanish and German he was assigned to interrogating prisoners of war. Eventually, Tyler served as an intelligence officer in the G-2 section of the US Army [^1]
