## Decade Breakdown
### 1900 *Or Earlier*
#### Education

St. John Philby demonstrated a keen intellect as a young student [^1]

He became a [Queen's Scholar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/King's_Scholar_(Westminster_School)), and elected to [Trinity College Cambridge](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk) with the junior Samwaies scholarship.[^2] [^3]

In Trinity College he studied Oriental Languages under [Edward Granville Browne](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edward_Granville_Browne), and was a friend and classmate of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was the first priminister of perhaps leading to some of his [[#Indian Civil Service |opinions]] in context to India.



#### Indian Civil Service

Philby Joined the Indian Civil Service on 13th October 1908 [^4] .

 Upon Arrival St John Philby claimed that he:

> [I] may have been the first Socialist to enter the Indian Civil Service, and I think that horrified most of my friends, by announcing, from the beginning that I am committed to Indian Independence
> 
> - St John Philby [Citation Needed]


 "In December 1908, St. John Philby arrived in India. While enroute to his first Civil Service post in Lahore a train accident nearly terminated his career." [^5] 
 
 During his post in India, Philby did not get payed an incredible amount, he was payed only £30 a month, but his day to day cost of living was only £5. The remaining money he sent to his mother. He found that he could get more pay in bonuses by picking up more languages, Philby began to pick up on a variety of languages, by the end of his service he had become proficient in many languages and dialects. [^6]

### 1910's
###### World War I

"As World War I developed, Philby resented being in a distant outpost. His brother, Paddy[^7], was killed in 1914, two days after entering the trenches in France. Philby tried every means possible to get where the action was, but to no avail." [^8]
##### India

In February 1915, he went to Calcutta and took an Urdu Examination. He passed, and earned a promotion to become the head of the Language Board. With the position came a doubling of his pay, presumably £60.

##### Iraq

Due to British advances in Mesopotamia against the Turks, [[Sir Percy Cox]] needed linguists and administrators[^9]. There is also reason to believe that [[Reader Bullard]] was involved in the employment of Philby because, he was also a student of [[Edward Granville Browne]], and someone who [[Sir Percy Cox]], thought was [[Reader Bullard#Sir Percy Cox's role in the increase of Bullards Pay: |valuable]].

In November 1915, he sailed for Basra [^10]. His job was to create a tax and banking system using promissary notes, to reduce need for British gold flow[^11]. [[Sir Percy Cox]] was very impressed by Philby's work.

By 1915, Philby was made District Officer in Amarah. He kept this post only for a few months, we do not know much about this period[^12].

Again in 1917, Philby was transferred to Baghdad to be [[Sir Percy Cox]]'s secretary. [[Arnold Wilson]], District Officer in Basra often complained about his heavy handed interference [^13]. In November 1917 he was sent to head a mission to Ibn Saud Some assume that St John Philby's change of post was due to his falling out with British command that suspect that St John Philby had a falling out with [[Gertrude Bell]] & [[Arnold Wilson]], and due to Philby's intereference with others, British administration then saw an open post to move him two and did so as swiftly as possible [^14]. Interested in exploration and of an adventurous disposition, he welcomed the opportunity to lead a diplomatic mission to central Arabia [^15].

##### Saudi
St John Philby arrived in Riyadh on November 30th 1917. 

Philby was assigned by [[Sir Percy Cox]] "the primary object to decide whether Ibn Sa'ud could take any additional action to advance the common cause against the Turks" : 

- Philby was to determine the amount of military and financial assistance which Ibn Sa'ud would require before he could mount a large scale offensive against Ibn Rashid with a reasonable prospect of capturing Hail conduct. 
  - Philby calculated that Ibn Sa'ud would need for this purpose:
	- A total force of 15,000 men
	- 10,000 employed continuously in the field.
	- 50,000 per month ( estimated 5 per man per month)
	- Initial 20,000 (for the purchase of transport animals and foodstuffs.)
	- 10,000 modern rifles

- Philby was to convince [[Ibn Saud]] that he should improve relations with Kuwait.

- Philby was to convince [[Ibn Saud]] to ease tensions with Sherif Hussein of Mecca 

Philby is said to have distorted these goals, he distorted them with the views of [Sir Reginald Wingate](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sir-Reginald-Wingate-1st-Baronet) arguing that:

> "The principal object of the Najd Mission was, therefore, to launch Ibn Saud into a campaign of active aggression against the Turks (In Hail), which I interpreted, for all practical purposes, as meaning a campaign against Ibn Rashid with the capture of Hail as its chief objective"

However Philby did complete his objectives found the first two tasks relatively easy, Ibn Saud was willing to take advantage of any British aid. It was the last task the one that was most emphasized by [[Sir Percy Cox]], that proved to be difficult for St John Philby.

Firstly, [[Ibn Saud]] was annoyed that his stipend was only 5,000 aswhere Sherif Hussein recieved 200,000 a month. 

Philby wanted to see to what test the extent of [[Ibn Saud]]'s power, Philby talked Ibn Saud into allowing him to pass through Jeddah. This exercise would prove that Ibn Saud controlled the vast desert and could protect British officials. Hussein portrayed [[Ibn Saud]] as too weak to do this. and it would allow Ibn Saud direct contact with a high official to whom he could present his request for more support.

Suddenly British attitudes towards [[Ibn Saud]] changed at the Eygptian offices due to Edmund Allenby's successes in Southern Palestine. So in the beginning of 1918 it became apparent to British officials that it was less important from a military perspective the role of [[Ibn Saud]]. British officials are quoted having opinions such as: 'Armament on large scale of Ibn Saud is liable to precipitate conflict between latter and King Hussein' and that Armament was a 'a great danger to the peace of Arabia. To ensure a balance of power, Hail had better remain independent'.

###### Pre Saudi




###### Early Life
He was born on April 3 1885 in Ceylon, Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka was not a state at the time) to a Father by the name of Henry M. Philby who was attempting, presumptiously not too successfully to be a Tea Planter. His Mother, May Philby, who had bared four children and put up with Henry's nonesense, left Ceylon to raise her children in England. 

John Philby showed intellect as a young student and won a scholarship to Westminster, due to his mothers financial problems this was the only way he could go to higher education.

Philby studied modern languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1904 to 1907.

Philby then was fluent in German, French and English and spent an additional year afterwards learning Persian and Urdu. That was when he was accepted to the Indian Civil Service.

###### Military
###### Indian Civil Service

> I may have been the first Socialist to enter the Indian Civil Service, and I think that horrified most of my friends, by announcing, from the beginning that I am committed to Indian Independence
> 
> - St John Philby

He was Stationed in and Around Punjab, he almost ended his career and life in a train accident in his first Service Post in Lahore, India. His superiors noticed his dillegence and hard-working spirit.

During his time in India he picked up on different Dialects in Urdu and Baluch.

While on a leave to Rawalpindi, he met a beautiful young lady, Dora Johnson, the daughter of an officer of the Indian Public Works Department. Philby's superiors counseled him.  His mother was apprehensive about a loss of her allowance and thus opposed his marriage. 

Disregarding the opposition, Philby married Dora on September 20, 1910. During the next year his mother was not able to manage financially and Philby had her move to India. [^1]

[[Kim Philby]] was born on New Year's Day, 1912."

Due to British advances in Mesopotamia against the Turks Philby was forced to relocate.

###### Arabist

> In late 1915, Percy Cox recruited Philby as head of the finance branch of the British administration in Baghdad. The position included fixing compensation for property and business owners. The mission was to organise the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks and to protect the oil fields near Basra and the Shatt al Arab, which were a source of fuel for the Royal Navy. The revolt was organised with the promise of creating a unified Arab state, or Arab federation, from Aleppo, Syria, to Aden, Yemen. Gertrude Bell was his first controller and taught him the finer arts of espionage. In 1916 he became Revenue Commissioner for the British Occupied Territories.

Philby's first assignment was to analyse the finances of the territory and draw up a regular system of accounts. He also set up a tax and banking system using promissary notes which greatly reduced the burdensome problem of gold flow with England.

By 1917 Philby was made a district officer in Amarra.

The British wanted Ibn Saud to stop the smuggling of of supplies to the Turks in Syria. Philby wanted to be the liaison officer 9 to Ibn Saud & so Philby was on his way to meet Ibn Saud.

He was sponsored by D. G Hogarth

###### Interim Moments 
After being forced out of Jidda to Cairo went to Jerusalem where he began to look for Jobs in Syria as he was 
##### In Saudi 
###### First Meeting
St John Philby travelled from Baghdad to Saudi via camel, he achieved most of his  goals but Ibn Saud was angry about the amount of compensation he was recieving from the British. Ibn Saud and Philby did enjoy eachother's presence however. 

![[St John Philby on Camel.png]]


During his first couple of weeks he visited Jidda where he proceeded to talk with Sharif Hussein who spoke of the Wahhabi threat. 

Due to this he was not able to achieve all of his goals and was forced to leave on a cruiser to Cairo rather than the way he originally came.

###### Saudi Organizer?
![[St John Philby's Arrangement with Ibn Saud.png]]



> In 1932 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was officially declared and King Abdulaziz established a small circle of counsellors to deal with daily matters of state. This circle was called the Political Committee (al-Shu'bah al-Siyasiyyah). The Political Committee was mainly attended by King Abdulaziz's brother Prince Abdullah, his two elder sons Saud and Faisal, Haft Wahbah, Khalid al-Hakeem, Yusuf Yasseen,

###### Oil in Saudi
###### Pro-Americanization
 He was introduced to Ibn Saud by  H. St. John Philby, a former British army officer converted to Islam, played an important role in the United States' entrance upon the scene.[Defense Technical Information's Biography Of St John Philby](https://archive.org/details/dticarchive)


The Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, war in Korea, and American and European rearmament were all issues of the era serving to strengthen the evolving United States-Saudi Arabian relationship via oil. The post-World War II oil shortage scare, like that of post-World War I and that of a future era, served to emphasize the importance of Saudi Arabian oil. Oil exports from the United States to Europe decreased after the war and in 1948 the United States became, for the first time, a net importer of crude oil. Saudi Arabia’s rapidly increasing production and proven reserves paralleled the increasing needs of the free world. Saudi Arabian crude production increased from less than one-half million barrels in 1938 to nearly eight million in 1944, over 21 million in 1945, and about 200 million barrels by 1950. 22


###### The California Standard Oil Company (SOCAL)
St. John Philby was approached by Francis B. Loomis, former Under Secretary of State of the United States, to inquire about the possibilities of an oil concession for SOCAL in Arabia.
#### [[Charles Crane]]
 
 Crane helped finance the first explorations for oil in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. He was instrumental in gaining the American oil concession there.
 
 Crane Introduced [[Karl Twitchell]] to Ibn Saud
###### Israel And Zionism
> 	For example, Chaim Weizmann made a proposal that was communicated to Ibn Saud through Philby in 1940. Taking advantage of In Saud'sfinancial needs,the Zionist leaders offered him £20 million if he would changehis attitude to the Palestine Question and settle all the Palestinian Arabs in his country (Philby, 1952: 213-214; Wahbah, 1960: 178-179). Given Ibn Saud's resolute stance, the Zionists continued their attempts through the Americans; Harold Hoskins, the delegate of President Roosevelt, met Ibn Saud in July 1943 and discussed the Palestinian issue with him. During this meeting Hoskins asked the King if he could meet Weizmann to discuss the Palestinian problem. The King refused to meet him due to his earlier attempt, through Philby, to bribe him. He described their attempt as a vile and criminal act ('Attar, 1972: 1266-1270; al-Zirikli, 1977a: 1138-1143; Abu'Ulayyah and al-Natshah, 1999: 115-117). 


Although it seems Philby was relatively neutral to the establishment of the state of Israel, it appears he grows a hatred to the state of Israel, and sees it as a puppet to the British Government. Philby would regularly quote people like Gamel Abdel Nasser on the establishment of Israel. My Analysis is however contrary to the book [The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed The Jewish People](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-War-Against-Jews-Espionage/dp/0312156480) which seems to be a reputable source on Robert Maxwell.



###### Fascist?
###### Opinions on WW2 
**When the Nazis moved on Prague, Philby advocated negotiations with Germany. He opposed the war and spoke openly about the probability of Britain losing it.** His proclamations were of serious concern to both the Saudi and British governments. When Philby told Ibn Saud that he was going to America, Ibn Saud informed the British government. Philby was to travel via Bombay to America. He set sail on August 3, 1940. Upon his arrival in Karachi, the British arrested Philby and shipped him to England. He was imprisoned under the Defense of the Realm Act, Sec. 18B. By March of 1941 he was released and considered a 'harmless fanatic'. During the rest of the war years he tried politics, and writing, but had no luck. By mid 1945, his only hope for financial gain was to return to Arabia.

![[St John Philby Wants Peace With Nazi Germany (Before WW2 Had Started).png]]
It is clear with


By 1930 he had converted to Islam and become an adviser to the then Saudi king, Ibn Saud. At one stage he briefly returned to Britain to stand as a candidate for the fascist British People's party. 
	![[St John Philby's Fascist Support.png]]
 
 
###### Relationship With Ibn Saud


> When Philby comes to describing Ibn Saud himself he emphasises above all what most struck him as a man of action and vigour himself. Ibn Saud was a man of inexhaustible energy, a man who put the affairs of his state above all other considerations. We learn that Ibn Saud habitually at this stage of his life had four hours' sleep a night and rested during the day, usually for two hours 
>-  McLoughlin 

###### The Political Committee



> Although various opinions have been proposed regarding the relationship of St John 
> Philby with the King, it should be remembered that he was one of the King's foreign 
> advisers for more than 30 years and he was greatly impressed by the charisma of Ibn 
> Saud and by his attitude, which finally convinced him to convert to Islam. According 
> to some writers, Philby was seen as very loyal to Ibn Saud and to the Arab cause, 
> which sometimes led him to work against the misguided policy of Britain toward the 
> Arabs; he eventually resigned from his official position with the British Government 
> as a protest against that policy, as he himself acknowledged 


> Philby is no more than a merchant and a commissioner.  
> - King Abdulaziz

>  Philby might also be said to have been an adviser, in so far as he was always ready with advice; but it was several years after the fall of Hail when he first joined his fortunes to Ibn Saud 's, and at his own wish he never held any paid or official position in the court.
