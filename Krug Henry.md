Miller and Henry had been sent to inspect the concession area, most of it in al-Hasa - an area that would in 1956 be officially named the "Eastern Province" - and to look for geological formations that might indicate the presence of oil. Since the concession area measured 371,263 square miles (961,567 square kilometers) - considerably larger than France - this was no small task.
