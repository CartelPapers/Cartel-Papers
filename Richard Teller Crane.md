> "My father began to work when he was 8 years old (Richard worked in a cotton mill; at 15 in a brass and bell foundry; by 21 he had also worked in the locomotive industry and in a number of printing press machine shops.[^1]) , doing various kinds of jobs until he finally got into the "Hoe Printing Press Works" in Brooklyn where he picked up the eleements of a half a dozen trades. The story of his uncle, Martin Ryerson, probably attracted him to the west and my father went sought him out  at his lumber yard in Chicago. His uncle was kind to him, offered him a corner of the lumber yard in which to build a shop all the lumber he needed and a thousand dollars in money. With that my father built a small brass foundry, set up his furnace and had everything in order on July 3, 1855. He was so anxious to try the work that he poured off his first pot of metal on July 4, 1855, establishing a tiny business which grew into the [[Crane Holding Company |Crane Company]]."
