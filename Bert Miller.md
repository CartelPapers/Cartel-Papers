Miller and Henry had been sent to inspect the concession area, most of it in al-Hasa - an area that would in 1956 be officially named the "Eastern Province" - and to look for geological formations that might indicate the presence of oil. Since the concession area measured 371,263 square miles (961,567 square kilometers) - considerably larger than France - this was no small task. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Khurma_Karim,_Saudi_Arabia,_1935_11.jpg
